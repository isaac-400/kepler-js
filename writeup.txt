Kepler's Laws Simulations 
=========================================
Isaac Feldman - 8/25/21

I focused my project on the learning objectives surrounding Keplers laws:

- Use Kepler's three laws to describe the motion of the planets.
- Understand and use Newton's version of Kepler's 3rd law

I tackle both of these learning objectives not only in the explainations visible in the
final product, but also in the realization of the project. Initially I used Newton's law
of gravitation to program a simulation of an orbiting planet to then prove Kepler's laws,
but I ran into issues in making the program efficient to run in the web browser. Instead I
used Kepler's laws and used his formulae to instead parameterize an ellipse and then
animate the planet's orbit along that ellipse. I also used Kepler's relations between
eccentric anomaly and true anomoly to plot the areas swept out by an orbiting planet.

In the explainations accompanying the simulations, I tried to summarize the content
effectively and briefly, leaving the interactivity to build the understanding in the user.
Ultimately, from the begining, I believe that being able to tinker with the course
concepts will make them stick and give students and the public a good working
understanding of the science.

I also released the code and webpage to the public, so other students, scientists and
professors can hopefully use it to help spark people's curiosity of astronomy.
