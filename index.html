      Johannes Kepler, a german mathematician, devised some of the most important relationships we
      know of in astronomy: the laws of planetary motion. 
      After analyzing observations of the motion of the planets in our solar system, he found that
      the planets following clear relationships and published these relationships in 1609.
    </p>
    <p>
      These simulations let you see what Kepler did (with the benefit of some hindsight). 
      Play around with them and test your own hypotheses about planetary motion!
    </p>

    <h2>First Law: Planets Move in Eliptical Orbits</h2>
    <div class="sketch" id='k1' ></div>
   	<figcaption>The planet moves in an ellipse, with the distance to the star constantly changing</figcaption> 
    <p>
      Kepler's first law is a simple but powerful assertion: any orbiting body travels in an
      elliptical path. For things in our solar system that means that the planets travel in
      ellipses with the Sun at one of the foci.

      The planets in our solar system travel in near circular paths with the most 
      eccentric<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup>
      planet being Mercury. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Second Law: Equal Areas swept out by a planet along its orbit will be traversed in the same time</h2>
    <div class="sketch" id='k2'></div>
   	<figcaption>Use the sliders the change how large an area to sweep out. The simulation will show how long it takes the planet to traverse this area</figcaption> 
    <p>
      Kepler's second law tells us about how orbiting bodies move along these ellipses.
      It states that for any equal area swept out by an orbiting body is traversed in the same
      time. Kepler drew this conclusion from noting that planets change speed as they orbit. 
      As they get closer to the Sun they speed up and when they are far away, they slow down.
      This is especially clear to see with commets or other bodies that pass close to the sun.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Law: The period of rotation is related to the semi major axis</h2>
    <div class="sketch" id='k3'></div>
   	<figcaption>Use the sliders to adjust the average distance between the planet and star and the eccentricity of the orbit. Watch how the orbital period changes</figcaption> 
    <p>
      Kepler's third law gives us a powerful relation that we can use to estimate distances and
      masses of orbiting bodies near and far away. It states that the time it takes for a body
      to complete an orbit squared is proportional to its average distance from the star cubed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be more specific:
      $$
      T^2 \propto a^3 
      $$
      Where \(T\) is the time it takes to complete one rotation (orbital period) and \(a\) is the average distance from the star (semi-major axis)
    </p>
    Combining this relationship with Newton's Law of Gravitation<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup> allows us to estimate the
      masses of distant binary stars and oribitng exoplanets!

      <h3> Footnotes</h3>
      <p id="fn1"><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Eccentricity is the ratio of the distance between the center and a focus to the semi-major axis. The higher this value, the more streched the orbit is.</p>
      <p id="fn2"><a href="#r2">[2]</a> Newton actually showed that the realtionship between orbital period and semi-major axis contains a factor that is the sum of the two bodies' masses: 
      $$
      \frac{a^3}{T^2} = G\frac{M+m}{4\pi^2}
      $$
      Where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) and \(m\) are the masses of the bodies. So if you can measure semi-major axis and period, you can deduce the combined mass of the system!
